\\\JUNIOR WEB DESIGN AND DEVELOPER///
====================================

Just starting out in the world of Web Development. Here are some of the projects that we have worked on in school in which I will continously update once I get some work in.

I am proficient in HTML and CSS, and have entry level understanding of PHP principles. I also enjoy working with WordPress sites and striving to do better in that aspect.

Hope you enjoy!
